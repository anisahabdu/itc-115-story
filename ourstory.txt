Once upon a time there was a class called ITC 115. 
There was group named Number 2. There were the greatest breakout room of all time.
The group was made up of 4 Super powered individuals. Stanley aka Finesse who had the power to finesse any body. With his silver tongue ability he could convince anyone to do his bidding by commanding them.
Emmanuel also called E-man was the powerhouse of the group, also known as Mr. FixIt, there was no problem E-man didnt have a solution for. He was always a step ahead. His programming skills are unparalleled and the rest of the groups were no match for the E-Man Power.

Once upon a time there was a class called ITC 115. 
There was group named Number 2. They were the greatest breakout room of all time.
The group was made up of 4 Super powered individuals. Stanley aka Finesse, who had the power to finesse any body. 
With his silver tongue ability he could convince anyone to do his bidding by commanding them.
The leader of pack, Anisah the jokester ,used her wit and humor as she paved the path of triumph in the land of GIT.
Aven Zemo is a Scientific master mind, a skilled strategist who is efficient in all forms of combat.
Emmanuel, also called E-man, was the powerhouse of the group, also known as Mr. FixIt. There was no problem E-man didnt have a solution for. 
He was always a step ahead. His programming skills are unparalleled and the rest of the groups were no match for the E-Man Power.
All of a sudden, Number 2 were all awaken by the gusting winds of Santa Barbra beach. They were all stranded, after being left behind by the villians of Canvas. 
They all came to realization that all these powers were just a pinnacle of their imagination. But the one thing that they knew wasn't just a dream, was that they were in class, 
dreading the next breakout room they'll be put in. For Number 2 was still and always will be the greatest breakout room of all time.  
And they all were living happilly ever after living their respective lives ...... until.......... the villain "New-Manniac" striked 
This evil Villian "New Manniac" was diabolical to say the least. New Manniac's sole mission was to gather the cache of cookies to sell classifiede Number 2 data to the highest bidder.
